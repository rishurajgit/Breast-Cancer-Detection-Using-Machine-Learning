# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to assist in the early detection of breast cancer using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Early diagnosis is crucial for improving survival rates, and this project provides a simple yet effective web-based prediction app that can classify whether a breast tumor is malignant  or benign  based on input medical data.
